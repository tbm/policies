Conservancy's Policies
======================

These are the policies of the [Software Freedom Conservancy, Inc.](https://sfconservancy.org).

License
-------

To the extent possible, Conservancy disclaims all copyright on the documents
herein, and provides them under the
[CC-0 1.0 Universal copyright waiver and fallback license](CC0-1.0.txt).
Conservancy kindly asks that you remove Conservancy's name and all references
to contact information of our organization if you reuse these policies for
your own organizations and projects.

Contributing
------------

The canonical location for this repository is
[on Conservancy's Kallithea instance](https://k.sfconservancy.org/policies).  Copies of this
repository elsewhere, such as Github, are for backup purposes only.  If you
have contributions, submit them on via Conservancy's Kallithea instance.

These policies are discussed in public with Conservancy's member projects and
other Conservancy enthusiasts on
[the polices-discuss mailing list](https://lists.sfconservancy.org/mailman/listinfo/policies-discuss).

The 'master' branch in this repository denotes the current polices that are
in-effect for the Software Freedom Conservancy, Inc.  Proposals are made by
people in
[pull requests on k.sfconservancy.org](https://k.sfconservancy.org/policies/pull-request),
and then if the [Conservancy staff](https://sfconservancy.org/about/staff/)
plans to propose them to
[Conservancy's Board of Directors](https://sfconservancy.org/about/board/),
they are merged into the 'ready-for-board-approval' branch.  Once approved by
the Board of Directors, Conservancy staff merges the changes into the
'master' branch.

Proposing A Change
------------------

If you would like to propose a change in Conservancy's official policies,
please submit a
[pull request on k.sfconservancy.org](https://k.sfconservancy.org/policies/pull-request).
Since Kallithea's workflow is confusing to some, Conservancy will accept
[pull requests on GitHub](https://github.com/conservancy/policies/pulls), but
the latter will only be accepted from members of Conservancy Project
Leadership Committees.

Once you've created a pull request, post a message summarizing your reasons
for the change to
[the polices-discuss mailing list](https://lists.sfconservancy.org/mailman/listinfo/policies-discuss).
(Note that anyone is permitted to join the list, and posts by
non-list-members are held in moderation.)  Participate in discussion there,
and Conservancy staff will either explain why the change isn't possible, or
will merge it into the 'ready-for-board-approval' branch, and will present
the change at the next Conservancy Board of Directors meeting.

Using These Policies Elsewhere
------------------------------

Other organizations are encouraged and welcome to create forks of this
repository for their own policies at their organization.  We ask that
Conservancy's name be removed from any forks that you make to avoid
confusion.  We've licensed these policies [CC-0](CC0-1.0.txt) to make it easy
to incorporate the text into other documents, but ask that you nevertheless
respect our wishes and remove our name from your forked versions.  Thanks!
