Software Freedom Conservancy Travel and Reimbursable Expense Policy
===================================================================

== Overview

This Travel and Reimbursable Expense Policy (``Policy'') applies to all
Conservancy Member Projects (``Projects'') of Software Freedom Conservancy
(``Conservancy'') and has been created to memorialize Conservancy's
reimbursement policies relating to travel and other business expenses
incurred by Conservancy staff, Project Leadership Committee (``PLC'')
members, and project volunteers while engaged in business on behalf of, or
at the behest of Conservancy and/or a Project (``Travelers'').

This Policy includes an Easy Reference Guide that can be used as a 
template for most of the travel covered under this Policy.  When in doubt,
refer to the more detailed sections below.  

== Purpose

Conservancy must maintain effective control of business-related expenses
in order to maintain its financial viability and tax exempt status.  
Conservancy and each Project is also accountable to our donors to ensure 
that we manage their contributions wisely and maximize our ability to 
pursue our charitable mission.  As such, Conservancy expects Travelers to 
use good judgment and to claim reimbursement for only those expenses that 
are necessary and reasonable.  Excessive expenses, including but not 
limited to luxury accommodations and services unnecessary for, or unrelated 
to the furtherance of Conservancy's charitable mission are not eligible for 
reimbursement. 

Any travel expense that adheres to this Policy is considered In-Policy
and does not require special approval, so long as the trip itself
has been approved in writing by Conservancy's Executive Director or
by a Project's Leadership Committee (``PLC'') in a regular and documented
PLC vote.  Conservancy and/or a PLC can limit allowable travel expenses
to an amount less than what would otherwise be considered acceptable
according to this Policy. If so, the smaller budget is the maximum
allowed expense. 

PLC's may, in fact, have their own travel policy that is more restrictive
than this one.  Please consult the PLC for your Conservancy project before
incurring an expenses to ensure you understand what expenses can be
reimbursed.

== Easy Reference Guide

Travelers should adhere to the following guidelines to stay In-Policy. 

* Flights.  
   * Before you buy tickets, save a screenshot of a flight search that
     shows the least expensive fare available from multiple airlines for
     the dates you need to travel.
   * Book at least 14 days in advance.
   * Fares within $100 of that lowest fare you found are In-Policy, even if
     you book on a different site or for different dates.
   * Fares over $750 domestically or $1,500 internationally require
     Conservancy's pre-approval.

* Hotels. 
   * Hotel fares < GSA rates are In-Policy.  Visit
     http://www.gsa.gov/perdiem to determine the rate for your
     destination.
   * Be sure the receipt from your hotel includes the dates of your
     stay, not just a total.

* Receipts.  Keep and submit PDFs of the following, as applicable:
   * Your fare search (i.e., a screen shot)
   * Your plane/rail ticket (e-confirmation of purchase is sufficient)
   * Your hotel/lodging invoice

* Per Diem.
   * Use your per-diem to cover meals and incidental expenses.
   * Your per-diem is based on GSA guidelines.  Visit
     http://www.gsa.gov/perdiem to the determine the per-diem for your
     destination.
   * Try to be frugal - GSM per-diem rates are rather generous.
   * When attending a conference where food is included, Do The Right
     Thing and claim a lower per-diem.

* Reimbursement.
   * To receive reimbursement, send hotel and flight/rail receipt,
     along with a list of Per Diem days and totals to
     accounting@sfconservancy.org.  Refer to the Expense Report
     section below for details.
   * Your complete reimbursement request must be submitted to
     accounting@sfconservancy.org within 90 days of the last date of
     travel.  Untimely requests *will not be reimbursed*.

== Reimbursement Procedure

Note that reimbursements are only processed once per week.  While we usually
can turn around reimbursements in about two weeks' time, please be advised
that Conservancy officially does reimbursements on a NET-30 basis, starting
from the date that complete materials are received.  If this is an issue,
Conservancy is available to prepurchase expensive items like airline tickets
on your behalf, so that you don't need to be reimbursed.

If you seek to be reimbursed for Conservancy Project expenses, please send
the following, in a self contained email (with attachments as necessary),
cc'ing your Project Leadership Committee address (PROJECT@sfconservancy.org)
for Project approval:

  * a brief paragraph explaining what was accomplished for the project
    during your travel and/or with the funds being reimbursed.  This can
    be informal; it's just for our records to confirm the travel advanced
    the not-for-profit mission of both Conservancy and the project.

  * A brief report listing the items to be reimbursed.

  * Full receipt(s) for everything, unless the travel policy does not
    require receipts (e.g., for per diem expenses).

    If your receipts are in a different currency than your preferred one
    for reimbursement, include documentation of the rate conversion (e.g., a
    redacted credit card statement in your preferred currency).  Otherwise,
    Conservancy will use the prevailing rate for the date of the expense for
    conversion.

    Please verify that the receipts that you submit are within the attached
    travel policy requirements.  Note, however, that your Project Leadership
    Committee may have set a stricter budget than what the general
    Conservancy policy allows.

  * How you'd liked to be reimbursed. The four payment options, in order of
    Conservancy's preference, are:

    * PayPal.  For this, we need (a) the email address that is registered to
      the PayPal account that will receive reimbursement and (b) the
      preferred currency.  (Please verify that PayPal supports transactions in
      https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/sell/mc/mc_intro-outside[your
      preferred currency before choosing one].)
      Note that sometimes PayPal charges fees.  Usually we're taking
      funds from our PayPal balance, which means no fees appear on our side,
      but they may appear on yours.  In our experience, USA PayPal account
      holders physically in the USA are not typically charged fees; but we do
      advise you to check PayPal's fee schedule before choosing this method.

      NOTE: Typically, when choosing PayPal as a payment option, amounts owed
            in USD will be paid in USD, regardless of your preferred currency
            selection.
      
    * Issue you a check in USD from a USA bank, sent to you via post.
      For this option, I just need your postal address.

    * Wire the amount in your local currency to your bank account in your
      country.  For this option, I need as much of the following information
      as it's possible for you to collect.

      Required information
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      * Full Name of the Account Holder
      * Full Address of the Account Holder
      * Account Number
      * Preferred Currency
      * Bank Name
      * Bank Address
      * Bank ACH or ABA routing number (for banks in the US);
        or SWIFT and/or BIC code (for banks outside the US)

      Additional required information by country
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      * All countries inside the EU: IBAN

      * Australia: BSB or "Bank Code"

      * Brazil: Tax ID of the Account Holder (your 14-digit CNPJ or
          11-digit CPF); Phone Number of the Account Holder;
          and Bank Agency Code

      * Colombia: Tax ID of the Account Holder; and Phone Number
          of the Account Holder

      * India: IFSC Code

      * Qatar: IBAN

      * Russian Federation: Beneficiary INN; Patronymic Name of Beneficiary;
          and VAT/VO Code of Beneficiary Bank

      * Ukraine: BSB or "Bank Code"; Tax ID of the Account Holder;
          and Phone Number of the Account Holder

      Additional information we can use
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Banks outside the US will often designate a Correspondent Bank when
      receiving funds from the US.  If you can give us the Correspondent
      Bank Name and ACH, we can specify that in the wire.  Your bank will
      usually take the fewest fees when receiving wires from its
      Correspondent Bank, so this will mean the most money for you.

  * A check in your local currency, sent to you via post. For this option, we
    just need your postal address and what currency you want. Note that this
    is a more involved option to process and will usually take at least 30
    days to issue payment.  We do not recommend this method.  Please choose
    it only if you absolutely cannot receive a wire transfer for some reason.

Project Leadership Committees: when you see emails of this nature, please
be sure to have your designated Representative review the materials and
send an approval message to Conservancy.


== Project Leadership Committee Review

Conservancy foresees the need for periodic reasonable exceptions to
this Policy.  Persons working on behalf of a specific Project seeking
an exception to this Policy must petition their PLC to obtain written
approval from Conservancy authorizing the exception.  Persons working
directly on behalf of Conservancy seeking an exception to the
Policy must obtain written approval from Conservancy authorizing the
exception. 

PLCs are responsible for creating procedures for requesting exceptions, 
and submitting to Conservancy reimbursement requests associated with
their respective Projects.  PLCs are also responsible for making available
a list of required response times for inquiries, including but not
limited to, the following two cases

* a specific number of days to respond to regular reimbursement requests,
and

* a specific number of days to respond to pre-authorization requests.

PLCs are also responsible for monitoring the available balance in their
Project Fund, and for granting or refusing approval for travel expense 
requests based on an assessment of the funds available and of any
outstanding contracts payable.  PLCs are not to approve travel expense 
requests when their Project does not have sufficient funds to cover the 
expense.  If a PLC has any questions regarding whether their Project has 
sufficient funds to cover a Traveler's expense request, the PLC should 
contact Conservancy.

== Transportation

=== Overall transportation Cost

Domestic transportation costs greater than US$750 requires Conservancy 
approval prior to booking, even if all other Policy conditions have been 
met.  International transportation costs greater than US$1,650 requires 
Conservancy approval prior to booking, even if all other Policy conditions 
have been met.

=== Advance Purchase

Tickets for travel by air or rail (excluding commuter train and subway) 
should be booked at least 14 days in advance; any travel booked less than 
14 days in advance requires written pre-authorization by Conservancy.  
Tickets for travel by air or rail beyond 365 days in advance also require 
written pre-authorization by Conservancy.

=== Air Travel

==== Class of Service

Coach and/or Economy Airfare is the only acceptable class for all flights
(domestic and international) unless a PLC provides a special exception and
a valid reason (such as a need for business class due to a documented
medical reason) to Conservancy for written approval.  Travelers may select
their airline of choice (e.g., for the purpose of collecting airline miles
and rewards), provided that the resulting air fare otherwise meets the
requirements of this Policy.  Travelers should not book out-of-Policy trips
(and thus pay a higher fare) in order to qualify for a mileage upgrade.

==== Advance Purchase

Air travel should be booked at least 14 days in advance; any travel booked
less than 14 days in advance requires written pre-authorization by
Conservancy.  Flights beyond 365 days in advance also require written
pre-authorization by Conservancy.

==== Low Fare

Conservancy aims to balance cost savings with convenience and considers
flights that are within US$100 of the lowest logical fare to be within
Policy.  The lowest logical fare is the least expensive fare available from a
fare search that meets all of these criteria:

  * The search must include fares from multiple airlines.
  * The search must cover only the dates of relevant travel.  For example, if
    you're attending a conference that runs Monday through Friday, the search
    must have you arriving no earlier than Sunday, and leaving no later than
    Saturday.
  * Except as allowed by Policy, the search must not use filters that might
    exclude the least expensive fare.  For example, you may filter out
    flights with two or more connections, since Conservancy does not
    consider those reasonable.  However, you may not filter out specific
    airlines, or flights without WiFi.

Any widely-recognized airfare search site that lists results from multiple
airlines is acceptable, including sites such as http://orbitz.com[Orbitz],
http://kayak.com[Kayak] or http://hipmunk.com/[Hipmunk].  The PLCs and/or
the traveler must submit the output (such as a screenshot or printout from
the browser) of a online fare search as part of documentation in airfare
pricing.  Make sure the output shows the least expensive fare available.
Travelers may book their tickets on different dates or a different site as
long as they used a qualifying fare search site to determine that the
booked flights are within Policy.

Any flights greater than US$100 over the lowest logical fare require
written pre-authorization by Conservancy.

==== Reasonable Flights

Conservancy asks that Travelers allow for flexibility with respect
to departure times during a desired day of travel, as well as longer
trips in order to reduce cost.  However, Conservancy does consider
flights with two or more connections as unreasonable and does not
expect Travelers to consider those flight options to be reasonable.

==== Excess Baggage

Should a team member travel on an airline that charges for a single piece
of checked baggage, such a baggage expense is eligible for reimbursement.
Team members are responsible for charges on any baggage beyond a single
piece, unless that additional baggage is materials specifically related to
the Project's and Conservancy's mission (i.e., bringing t-shirts and other
promotional materials to an event).

==== Out-of-Policy Bookings

All air travel not adhering to the above Policies are considered Out-of-Policy
and require written pre-authorization by Conservancy's Executive Director.

==== Cancellation Fees

Cancellation fees and other penalties incurred result of a change
of plans are reimbursable at Conservancy's discretion.  In general,
Conservancy shall reimburse such fees if the Traveler can submit a
valid reason for the change of plans.  Acceptable reasons include Conservancy
and/or the PLC canceling or altering the trip or unexpected delays
in flight connections.  In instances where these fees are incurred
without adequate explanation, Conservancy reserves the right to refuse
to reimburse the cost of the fees. 

=== Other Transportation

==== Ground Transportation

Ground transportation necessary as part of authorized Project trips
is considered to be a reasonable expense.   Public ground transportation,
such as taxis, shuttles, buses and municipal transit, are generally
the most cost-effective options and are the standard for eligible
ground transportation reimbursements.  All car rentals require pre-authorization
by the PLC or by Conservancy's Executive Director.  When car rentals
have been pre-approved, the rental of compact cars is encouraged;
mid-size vehicles are authorized when necessary (e.g., when compact-sized
vehicles are not available or the number of passengers or volume of
baggage makes a compact vehicle impractical). 

==== Rail Transportation

Rail transportation as a means of travel for an authorized Project
trip is considered to be a reasonable expense.  All rail transportation
must be in economy and/or coach class.

==== Use of Personal Vehicles

When circumstances require Travelers to utilize their personal vehicles
for Project purposes, they can be reimbursed at the current USA IRS
rate per mile, plus any related parking expenses and toll fees.  Drivers
are encouraged to find the lowest cost parking area reasonably near
their destination.

== Lodging

Travelers are expected to be cost-conscious and prudent when booking
lodging for approved trips, and to verify that rates are within the
established per-diem rates for the geographic area of travel.

If the cost per-diem of lodging chosen by the Traveler and/or the PLC
exceeds the
http://www.gsa.gov/perdiem[United States General Services Administration's Per Diem calculator]'s ``Max lodging'' column and/or
http://aoprals.state.gov/web920/per_diem.asp[United States Department of State's ``Foreign Per Diem Rates by Location'' calculator]'s 
``Maximum Lodging Rate column'' for the given location (per Traveler), the Traveler
and/or the PLC *must* obtain written
pre-approval from Conservancy and the PLC before booking the hotel.  If
written pre-approval is not sought or is not granted, Conservancy will only
reimburse up to the amount in the rate table above.

Lodging documentation submitted as part of a reimbursement request must
include a copy of the hotel invoice detailing all charges (credit card
receipts *alone* are unacceptable).  In particular, since Conservancy only
reimburses for room charges (plus relevant taxes and fees) for the necessary
travel dates, the receipt from the hotel must clearly show the dates of stay,
and separately list room charges and any food or service charges.
Conservancy will not reimburse Travelers for any costs associated with an
upgrade of room accommodations.

In some cases, Conservancy, upon consultation with the PLC, may decide to
book lodging on behalf of Travelers.  In this case, Conservancy-booked
lodging is always considered In-Policy.

== Other Reimbursable Expenses

Conservancy will reimburse persons for Project-related expenses that
are incurred while traveling on approved Project business and/or approved
Conservancy business. Only necessary, ordinary and reasonable expenses
are eligible for reimbursement, and only those categories of expenses
listed in this document qualify. 

=== Meals and Incidental Expenses

==== Overview

Travelers can submit for a per diem for meals and incidental expenses
for every day of a trip devoted to Project- and/or Conservancy-related
mission work, including the day(s) of travel itself.  Maximum per diem
rates for travel within the United States shall be based on the
http://www.gsa.gov/perdiem[United States General Services Administration's Per Diem calculator],
using the ZIP code of the travel destination.  For example, a Traveler
based in Palo Alto, CA heading to a conference in Atlanta, GA (with
a layover in Dallas, TX each way) will use the ZIP code of the destination
in Atlanta to calculate the maximum per diem for the entire trip,
including days of travel.

Maximum per diem rates for locations outside
of the United States shall be based on the
http://aoprals.state.gov/web920/per_diem.asp[United States Department of State's ``Foreign Per Diem Rates by Location'' calculator]'s ``Meals & Incidental Expenses'' (M&IE) column,
using the name of a listed city closest to the travel destination.
For example, a Traveler based in Palo Alto heading to a conference
in London, England (with a layover in New York City) has a maximum
per diem of the M&IE per diem listed London for the entire trip,
including days of travel. 

These per diem rates are the maximum daily rate Travelers can claim.  If a
conference has provided food, or food is provided in some other form, or
the costs the Traveler incurs are lower than this rate, then the Traveler
should reasonably reduce their per diem claim.
In addition, Conservancy generally encourages Travelers to be conservative with per
diem submissions, and consider asking for less if the full per diem
amounts allowed were not used during travel.

PLCs and/or Conservancy have the authority to set lower per diems
than those generated by the calculators above.  In those instances,
Travelers will only be able to submit for the lower per diems. 

==== Group Meals

For groups of Travelers on an In-Policy trip, each Traveler should
pay for his/her own meals, seeing as all participants will have an
opportunity to submit for separate per diems after the trip. 

For clarification purposes, this Policy does not relate to planned
group events that include meals and/or refreshments (e.g., a PLC-organized
conference that includes lunch for all attendees).  Further, PLCs and/or
Conservancy retain the right to allocate a separate budget for anticipated
large group meals beyond the individual per diem limits of each Traveler,
provided that they are within the PLC's technical objectives and/or
Conservancy's mission.  Travelers anticipating a need to cover such
a large group meal should seek pre-approval from his/her PLC and/or Conservancy
for such expenses before the trip. 

For any such group meal, Conservancy will require a written paragraph
summary of the meeting, indicating what was accomplished for the Project's
and Conservancy's mission.

==== Meals For Organizational Development

Travelers may occasionally have the need to invite third parties,
e.g., prospective donors, contributors, community members, etc., to
meals in order to further a PLC's technical direction and/or Conservancy's
mission.  Conservancy recommends that Travelers seek pre-approval from
their PLC and/or Conservancy for such meals.

For any such organizational development meal, Conservancy will require a
written paragraph summary of the meeting, indicating what was accomplished
for the Project's and Conservancy's mission.

==== Phone Call Charges Part of Per Diem

Charges for personal phone calls (e.g., made from a hotel, or via
a mobile phone in international travel) are not reimbursable as an
expense separate from the allocated per diem. 

==== Currency Conversion Charges Part of Per Diem

Any fees associated with currency conversion are not reimbursable as an
expense separate from the allocated per diem.

=== Conference Registration Fees

Conservancy will reimburse conference registration fees up to $100 per day
for Travelers on approved Project business and/or approved Conservancy 
business.  For example, a $250 registration fee for a 3-day conference is
In-Policy; however, a $225 registration fee for a 2-day conference is not. 

Travelers seeking reimbursement for registration fees that exceed $100 per 
day must obtain prior approval from Conservancy's Executive Director.  

=== Internet Access

Internet access/wi-fi fees charged by a hotel are reimbursable, provided
that they are listed on the hotel/lodging invoice submitted for 
reimbursement.  Other internet access fees (e.g., airport internet 
services, personal wi-fi hotspots, internet cafes) are not reimbursable 
except as incidental expenses to be covered by a Traveler's per-diem.  

== Additional Days of Travel

Travelers often seek to add extra days before or after an approved trip
(e.g., the weekend before a conference). A Traveler may seek approval for
the expenses associated with an extended stay prior to booking the trip,
provided that the additional days are solely to enable a Traveler to
conduct work within the PLC's objectives and Conservancy's charitable
mission, or to get a particular airfare that *reduces* the overall cost of
the trip.  Travelers may seek approval to book travel itineraries that
include extra days for personal reasons, so long as the cost of the flight
meets the other requirements of this Policy.  Other expenses incurred
during extra personal days beyond transportation costs are not reimbursable.

== Non-reimbursable Expenses

Non-reimbursable expenses are identified throughout this policy.  The
following items are typically non-reimbursable expenses: 

* Partner, spouse, and/or companion travel

* First class travel (unless medically necessary)

* Upgrades to air travel, car rentals, or hotel rooms

* Purchase of clothing, luggage, toiletries and other miscellaneous
personal items 

* Supplemental travel or car rental insurance

* Fines, penalties, or legal fees

* Personal entertainment or recreational expenses beyond the allotted per
diem

Travelers are permitted to pay for their own upgrades, or use bonus
programs to upgrade Conservancy-reimbursed expenses.  However, Travelers
must ensure that Conservancy does not receive nor reimburse any charges
for any such transaction.

== Satisfaction of IRS Requirements

Reimbursed travel expenses are subject to examination by the USA Internal
Revenue Service (IRS).  Travelers are responsible for retaining documentary
evidence that all expenses are strictly for Project- and/or
Conservancy-related purposes, not personal in nature, and therefore not
includable as taxable income to the Traveler.  Receipts are required for
all expenses, no matter the amount.

== Currency Exchange Rates

Expenses incurred in foreign currencies will be converted to US dollars
based on the exchange rate on the date of incursion.  The currency
exchange rate of record shall be done using
http://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/exchange/10-year-converter/[The Bank of Canada 10-year currency converter].

== Approvals

Travelers traveling on behalf of a Project must seek approvals and
submit expense reports to their PLC.  PLCs are to review those expense
reports and pass them along to Conservancy's Executive Director for
final approval and reimbursement. 

Travelers traveling on behalf of Conservancy must seek approvals and
submit expense reports to Conservancy's Executive Director.  Conservancy
staff must seek approvals and submit expense reports to Conservancy's
Treasurer or to another Conservancy Board Member designated by Conservancy's
Board. 

== Expense Reporting

Travelers seeking reimbursement must submit an expense report to the
appropriate channel with the following information:

* Name of Traveler 

* Brief description of trip and trip's purpose (e.g., ``August 2011
trip to XYZ conference for ABC project, served as planning committee
member''; ``Feb. '12 FOO hackfest in Portland, OR; contributed code'')

* A brief paragraph explaining what was accomplished for the project
during your travel.

* Number of days traveled (with documentary evidence, e.g., conference
itinerary, etc.) and associated per diem

* List of expenses not covered by per diem (e.g., transportation, lodging)
with substantiating receipts (or scans of receipts).

** In the event that it is impractical to obtain a required receipt and/or
if such receipt has been inadvertently destroyed or lost, the Traveler should
furnish a written statement to that effect, as well as an explanation
of the expenditure involved.  When possible, secondary documentation (such
as a redacted credit card bill) should be provided instead of the
lost/destroyed receipt.

Any expense without a substantiated receipt and/or a supporting written
statement will not be reimbursed. 

Conservancy requests that all expense reports be submitted within two
weeks of travel.  Expense reports filed more than 90 days after expenses
are incurred *will not be reimbursed*.

Reimbursements are paid by Conservancy on a NET-30 basis, from the
date of receipt by Conservancy of the fully complete report and supporting
documentation for the travel.

== Consequences of Policy Violations

Failure to comply with this policy may result in the denial of, or delay
in payment for, reimbursement requests.

== Policy Changes 

The Conservancy reserves the right to change any terms of this Policy
from time to time. The Policy of record shall be the Policy most recently
distributed by the Conservancy.
